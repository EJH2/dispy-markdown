# DisPy-Markdown

This is a Python port of [Brussell98's discord-markdown](https://github.com/brussell98/discord-markdown). The only 
reason this exists is because I didn't want to write another project's backend in Node. I have attempted a 1-1 
parallel, but due to the nature of JS and Python's differences in RegEx, there is no 100% guarantee.

## Using

Use this exactly how you would use discord-markdown, except everything is snake_case instead of camelCase. It's just
that easy!
